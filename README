wiegandextended-micropy
=========================

a somewhat platform agnostic (currently configured for stm32f411) micropython port of WiegandNGextended.ino
(available at https://gist.github.com/linuxgemini/9f089af171d5842eaaa4e0ae39f7d957 as usualâ„¢)

note if you're using a platform using the rp2 platform (aka raspberry pi pico):
    please use ampy ( https://github.com/scientifichackers/ampy ) to upload files one by one
    micropython for rp2 is a bit broken for file chunk uploads

files to upload are:
  - boot.py
  - main.py
  - lib/helpers.py
  - lib/wiegand.py
  - lib/wiegand_decoders.py
  - lib/hidreader.py
